No worries, it's totally fine.
That sounds like a great plan.
I'll get back to you soon.
Please let me know, thank you.

What do you think about this?
I haven't decided yet, honestly.
It depends on the situation, really.
That makes a lot of sense.
I see what you mean now.
Good point, I hadn't thought of it.
Fair enough, I understand now.
Can you repeat that for me?
I didn't quite catch that, sorry.
Could you speak a bit louder?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Let me explain it again, okay?
It's a long story, trust me.
To make a long story short.
In other words, it's simple.
The weather is really nice today.
It's supposed to rain later tonight.
I hope it doesn't snow tomorrow.
What a beautiful day outside, wow!
It's freezing cold out here now.
The sunset looks amazing right now.
Did you hear the latest news?
I just found out about it.
That's really interesting, tell me more.
I had no idea about that.
Are you serious right now, really?
You're kidding me, no way!
I can't believe it, wow.
That's so funny, I love it.
I'm so happy for you, congrats!
I'm sorry to hear that, truly.
That's too bad, I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it, relax.
Everything will be okay, trust me.
It's going to work out fine.
Stay positive, keep your head up.
One step at a time, okay?
Take it easy, don't rush now.
There's no hurry, take your time.
Whenever you're ready, let me know.
I'm ready when you are, go.
Let's get started on this now.
Are we all set to begin?
Almost done, just a bit more.
Finally, we're finished with this.
That took longer than expected, wow.
We made it, great teamwork!
I couldn't have done it alone.
Thanks for everything, I mean it.
It was my pleasure, honestly.
Anytime, don't hesitate to ask.
Feel free to reach out again.
I'm always happy to help you.
Is there anything else you need?
That should be everything for now.
I think we covered it all.
Sounds good, let's wrap it up.
Perfect, I'll talk to you later.
Have a great rest of your day!
Good morning, how did you sleep?
Good afternoon, how's your day going?
Good evening, are you free tonight?

I'll cook something quick, don't worry.
The food was absolutely delicious, wow.
Can I get the check, please?
I'll take care of the bill.
It's on me today, my treat.
Let's split the bill evenly, okay?
Do you need a ride home?
I'll pick you up at seven.
We should leave in five minutes.
Are we going the right way?
I think we're almost there now.
Turn left at the next light.
Keep going straight for two blocks.
We just missed the exit, sorry.
I need to stop for gas soon.
Where did you park the car?
The traffic is terrible right now.
We should take a different route.
How long until we get there?
It shouldn't take much longer now.
We finally made it, at last!
What a great trip that was.
I can't wait to go back.
Next time, let's plan ahead more.
